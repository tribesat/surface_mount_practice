# Surface Mount Practice

This board is designed to teach surface mount soldering. The circuit is an [astable multivibrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivibrator#Astable_multivibrator) that blinks the two LEDs. It was designed to be easy to assemble, and show clearly if it is working correctly or not.

This board was designed for use at the College of William and Mary's Small Hall Makerspace.
